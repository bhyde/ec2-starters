=== Downloading ===

To assure you can track improvements and contribute yours back please
use git to obtain your copy.

   git clone git://github.com/bhyde/ec2-starters.git

=== Requirements ===

You will need to have your environment set up approprately.  This
can be tedious, but well worth it.

Things you'll need or must be setup.
 - An EC2 account[1] including four of credentials they use
 - A S3 bucket where you'll store your starter bundles
 - The Amazon unix tools[2], i.e. ec2-run-instances, etc. etc.
 - A Unix tool chain include: bash, python, perl, awk, sed, grep
 - openssl
 - the python s3 tool s3cmd[3]
 - register at least one master ssh key[4] with ec2, which it can
   install into instances you run.  You have to give this key
   and ID, a good naming conventions is, by example, foo-master-key;
   for your application foo.

=== Configuration ===
 
Once you have all the above, then setup your configuration files.
Copy the examples, and edit them.  You don't need to edit the
machine-types file immediately.
 
   config/ec2.config.example -edit-> config/ec2.config 
   config/machine-types.example -edit-> config/machine-types
   config/trusted-ips.example -edit-> config/trusted-ips

In ec2.config change everyplace the word "example" appears.
Also drop the bit were it says "app1 app2" from the modules_path.
Later, when you start your own application, called say foo,
add a new subdirectory foo and add "foo" to the modules_path.

There is a lot of private info in config/ec2.config, so you will
want to set it's access bits approprately, for example:

   chmod or-rw config/ec2.config

You can check if your ready to go using the command

    bin/validate-configuration

=== Firewall Groups ===

It will almost certainly fail the first few times you try.
In particular you need to setup a firewall group, the one
configured the example machine-types is called demo-group.
We have a script to help set that up:

    bin/make-standard-firewall-group demo-group 'For the first demonstration.'

=== Building start up bundles ===

Once you've beat'n your configuration into submission then
you can create your first starter-bundle.

    bin/build-start-up-bundle demo


=== Spinning up Instances ===

And then you can spin up an instance of that

    bin/run-instance demo

=== Managing Your Instances ===

You can enumerate the things you have running using

    ec2-describe-instances

or

   bin/simple-describe-instances

The latter is useful when writing shell scripts.

=== Wrapping Up ===

Of course you murder your instances using

   ec2-terminate-instance

or the instance can commit sucide by vai "halt -p", just
don't do that on your own machine by mistake.
  bin/build-start-up-bundle.sh demo
