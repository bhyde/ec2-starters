RabbitMQ[1]is an implementation of the AMQP protocol in Erlang.

To add this to your instance include erlang and this in your
machine type, i.e.: erlang rabbitmq.

Then copy rabbitmq-config.sh-example over to rabbitmq-config.sh
and edit it configure
 - the erlang cookie you want all your erlang instances to use.
 - at least one user/password and one vhost.

That will give you a very simple single node setup, and if you
don't fiddle too much with the config then you will have only
one user and one vhost.
