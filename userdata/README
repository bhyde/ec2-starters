Recalling that each starter bundle consists of two parts:

 - The large encrypted file stored in EC2, and
 - The small bash script passed as user data to start that bundle.

the second parts are all stored here.  

Effectively the contents of this directory act to provide our database, or
bank of known starter-bundles.  The scripts in the bin directory are then
used to manage this collection.  Building and deleting them, spinning
up instances from them.

We do not check these into source control; so the .gitignore file of this directory is a bit unsual it reads:

   *
   !README

Each starter bundle is denoted by a name consisting of the machine type and a date stamp concatenated together.
